# arcgis-mapview-playground

This is a sample application, designed to demonstrate challenges
with the global "apiKey" used in the ArcGIS Javascript SDK. It is 
not considered production ready, and is intended for demonstration
purposes only.

Because it requires oAuth, it needs to be run in an environment
that ArcGIS can reach. One way to do this is through
[Replit.com](https://replit.com), and you're even welcome to fork
[my project](https://replit.com/@ToddRunstein/arcgis-mapview-playground)!
