# Basemap and Public Layer Conflicts

This example requires you to provide an Esri API key. It will then load
basemaps from the 
[Basemap Styles Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/basemap-styles/), 
as well as any FSL you wish to display. Note that the FSL must be publically
accessible, otherwise you'll run into other issues which this demostration is
not equipped to handle (by design).
