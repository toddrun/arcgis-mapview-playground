# "Free" basemap gallery

### Description
This just displays the basemaps that can be used without an api key
(based on the tables found 
[here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Map.html#basemap))

### Running
Checkout out the repo and then `yarn; yarn start`. That should take care
of everything you need!
